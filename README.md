# python-twitter-mining

This is a personal project to Data Mine Twitter using Python. 

The objectives of this project are

1. To practice and continue to learn Python. This will be the first time writing Python on my own after some initial Python tutuorials. 
2. To learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible research and to become more comfortable with that environment. 
3. Further practice using the Twitter API for data aquisition.
4. Develop some interesting questions regarding trends in Twitter data.
5. Identify potential topics for the Data Mining Course project at Elmhurst College.

All of my previous Data Science projects involved R or Tableau. The upcoming project in the Data Mining course I am currently taking involves mining Twitter with Python. However, because it is not a programming course, the actual code we will use is provided for us. I have wanted to learn python for a while and would prefer to get the code running from the ground up, so I'm undertaking this project several weeks ahead of the assigned project in hopes of learning and using my own coding. I assume I will be copying some code directly from the book as I go. However, I intend to first make progress on my own before referring to the code used in the text.
